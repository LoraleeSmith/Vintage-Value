# Vintage-Value
A way to find the value of vintage items or see if something is truly vintage.

The motivation for this app is that my spouse's mother collects vintage glassware and always has to look up if something is reproduction or not the hard way. I, myself, have began collecting various vintage inspired items and am slowly learning about the glassware. Because you have to look through books, search a variety of online sites for how much it goes for currently, or try to hunt down the pattern on the main website for glassware I though creating an image importing search using API's would be a useful idea.

The goal of this app is to use multiple API's to help with gathering searches and values, an image upload to help search by image and create an all around easier way to find true vintage.
